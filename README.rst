Description
===========
::

  The main idea of the project is to solve the high ambiguity of the author names in bibliographic data. In 
  most of the technical papers and publications, the authors are identified only by their name. 
  
  However, different people can have the same full name. So it is a very difficult task to specifically 
  identify the correct person when only the name is provided. The problem becomes even more challenging 
  when the alias names of the authors are provided, as a person can have multiple alias names. 
  
  We plan to remove the name ambiguity by plotting the authors in a social network graph using co-authorship
  as relations between nodes and then finding the best match of the author of a paper in the graph.
